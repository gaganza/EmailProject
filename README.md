# EmailProject
Person python project that I made using the GMAIL API. 

In order to use this program you have to have an API Key from Google, this can be found here: https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started

This script runs, sends a text messsage to the number that you specify in the code (XXXXXXXXXX@txtx.att.net - this is for att numbers). The message is a 4 digit code.
This code is used when filtering through your email. If a message has the code as the subject, the email is opened. marked as read, and the attatched files are then 
downloaded and the files are stored in a folder based off of their file extension.
